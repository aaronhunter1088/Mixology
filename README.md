Mixology is an application which allows a user create
custom drinks and ingredients, view them in a periodic
table format, and share drinks with friends.

The homepage allows anyone to come in and visualize the
application before making an account.
Visible in light and dark mode, and in English and French,
anyone can see the default drinks, the default ingredients,
and the API.

When you create an account, you can define your own drinks,
and ingredients, share them with friends, and manage your
user account by enforcing light or dark mode, the preferred
language, and upload a picture. You can also pick from the
default drinks, copy them to your set of drinks, and update
them according to how you see fit. 
The drink number allows you to rearrange your drinks, 
organized by the Alcohol type, in the specific order you
choose, allowing you to rank favorites amongst the alcohols.
